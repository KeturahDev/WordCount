| 2. program takes in a sentence | UserSentence: "this is my cowardly sentence" | program will be checking: *UserSentence*  |
| 3. program seperates the sentence into a list of idividual words by " " | UserDentence: "this is my cowardly sentence" | List of words: *this, is, my, cowardly, sentence*  |
| 4. "Count" method compares each word to KEY word and goes up by one with every instance of it in the sentence| List of words: *this, is, my, cowardly, sentence* | "Cow" count: *this **(no)**, is**(no)**, my**(no)**, cowardly**(no)**, sentence**(no)*** .. Count = 0 |
