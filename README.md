# Word Counter

#### C# Week Two Friday Project _March 6th 2020_

#### By _**Keturah Howard**_

## Description

Program takes in both a word and a sentence, and returns how many times the user has used the word in that sentence.

This project is being created with the intention of practing spec creation, redgreen workflow and basic MSTesting with C#.

## Specifications:


| Specification | Example Input | Example Output |
| :------------- |:-------------| :-------------------|
| 1. Program takes in a single word from the user | *(string)* user "cow" | program checks for.. KEY: *cow*  |
| 2. Program takes in a sentence from the user. | *(string)* UserSentence: "this is my cowardly sentence" | program will be checking: *UserSentence*  |
| 3. Program separates sentence into an array of the individual words of the sentence. | "this is my cowardly sentence" | { this, is, my, cowardly, sentence }  |
| 4. "Counting" method compares each word to KEY word and goes up by one with every instance of it in the sentence| *List* of words: *this, is, my, cowardly, sentence* | "Cow" count: *this **(no)**, is**(no)**, my**(no)**, cowardly**(no)**, sentence**(no)*** .. Count = 0 |
| 5. number of repititions is returned to user | user inputs word "hi", sentence "hi there" | "hi" is used: *1 time* |
| 6. Program removes the following punctuation from the sentence: . , / ! ? | key: "wow", sentence: "wow! wow, wow? wow." | processed collection of words: "wow wow wow wow wow" |


#### Elaborating descriptions for specs by number:
1. program needs to take into account the word the user wants to have checked. Input is one word. Output is information retained.
2. Program needs to recieve the sentence to check from. Input is sentence. Output is information retained.
3. Program needs to only check for whole word true comparisons, not just matching combinations of letters in a bigger word. Input is the sentence string (going into a method), which returns a list.
4. Program needs to be able to compare that sentence to word: Input is the list (returned from a method) into a counting method. Output is the number of repetitions, set to a property.
5. User Interface Based specfication: input is strings, output is interger transformed to readable string- all in Program.cs 
6. Elaboration spec to prepare for specification #3. Input is the sentence string, output is a new sentence string.
